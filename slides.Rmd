# What is Viral Marketing?

---
class: font160
# Viral Marketing

**Virality**: achieving a large number of views in a short time period due to consumers sharing content online. 


Why do we care about virality?

* Ability to reach vast audiences in a short period of time at low cost
* Increases brand visibility and recognition $\rightarrow$ brand equity 
* (Increase in sales?)

  * Tellis, MacInnis, Tirunallai and Zhang (2019,  Journal of Marketing)
* [Improvised Marketing Interventions in Social Media][borah]

# What Drives Virality?

# What Drives Online Sharing?

**Motivation**: What characteristics of an ad enhance its shareability? 

**Specific Questions**:

* Does information focussed content limit sharing?
* Does brand prominence decrease sharing?
* Do positive emotions increase sharing?

**How?**: Online video ads on YouTube

* Note: Paper is descriptive / predictive rather than causal

# YouTube Advertising Data

All video ads between Nov 25, 2013 and March 4, 2014

* Approx 1,962 video ads

Info they get via Youtube's API:

* Shares on Facebook, Twitter, Google +, LinkedIn over first 30 days

Info about Ads: sample of 360 of ads collected, covers 79 brands

* Got coders (i.e. paid some people) to watch ads and write down whats in it

# Ad Characteristics

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/tellis_ad_characs.png")
```

class: font140
# Regression Equation

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/tellis_regression.png")
```


Note: Think of this as a **descriptive** regression 

* They'll also use it for prediction on an (unseen) sample
* "Are these features predictive of shares?"  
  * My Q: If they really want to predict though, why not go machine learning route?

---
# Estimation Results

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/tellis_results.png")
```


---
class: font140
# Main Findings in Regression

* Information decreases shares
  * But not for a new products
  * And less for high price products

* Positive emotions lead to more shares
  * High arousal emotions not more effective than low arousal

* Timing of brand appearence and length of ad matters

**A critical eye**: They are cutting the data many ways for only 346 observations!

(Paper also discusses predictive power of model)

# Dramatic Elements and Emotions

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/tellis_results_02.png")
```

# Marketing Implications

Drivers of sharing important to understand to help ads get shared

* This sounds *a little too causal*
* ... as will a lot of their implications

The authors want us to believe:

* Less information
* More positive emotions 
* More careful brand placement

are important to promote online sharing

# Improvised Marketing Interventions

# Improvised Marketing Interventions

**Improvised Marketing Interventions (IMI)**: composition and execution of a real-time marketing communication
proximal to an external event

**Motivation**: Are IMI's effective at generating online sharing?

**Specific Questions**:

* Do IMI's result in greater virality?
* What type of IMI yields greater virality?
* Do IMIs enhance firm value?

**How?**: A mix of experiment, quasi-experiment and observational data

* We'll look at a subset of their results, focusing on the first two questions

# IMIs and Virality

**Context**: Superbowl blackout, 2013

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/oreo_tweet.jpg")
```

---
# Virality of Oreo Tweet

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/oreo_event.png")
```

---
# Virality of Oreo Tweet

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/oreo_results.png")
```

---
# Timeliness & Unanticipation

**Study 2**: mTurk Survey

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="30%", fig.show = 'hold', fig.ncol = 2}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figs/borah_timeliness.png", "figs/borah_anticipation.png"))
```


---
class: font160
# Marketing Implications

* IMI can help business connect with an audience weary of traditional advertising messages

* Humor and Timeliness important

* Keeping a close eye on trends and online chatter 
  * ... and being able to formulate a witty post/response

* Warning: Need to be careful that don't offend
  * Example: [Burger King on International Women's Day](https://globalnews.ca/news/7683800/burger-king-womens-day-kitchen-tweet/)

# Recap

class: font160
# Recap

* Viral Marketing is the rapid sharing of an ad online by consumers
* Ads are more likely to go viral if they:
  * Feature positive emotions
  * Are less informative
    * There are exceptions here - new prodcust, expensive products
  * Careful placement of brand name
* Improvised Marketing Interventions are heavily shared when they are timely and involve humor and aren't anticipated
